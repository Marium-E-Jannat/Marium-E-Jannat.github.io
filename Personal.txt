I’m a proud introvert, professional avoider of small talk, and Olympic-level champion in sitting quietly. While others hike through forests, I choose the more civilized route—planting myself in a peaceful spot with my trusty binoculars, letting nature come to me (because walking is highly overrated). I enjoy the finer, quieter things in life: crafting masterpieces, painting my feelings (mostly in pastel), and capturing the world through my camera lens without actually having to interact with it. If you're looking for someone to party loud and wild… keep looking—I’m probably hiding behind a tree, photographing a squirrel and hoping no one sees me.

Hi, I’m basically a human housecat—quiet, curious, and rarely seen in crowded places. I specialize in the fine art of sitting still while appearing deeply philosophical (I’m usually just admiring a leaf). I enjoy crafting things with my hands, painting stuff that may or may not be recognizable, and snapping photos like a nature paparazzi—minus the running part. Walking? No, thank you. That’s why I own binoculars: so I can appreciate far-off beauty while staying gloriously still. If you see me outside, it’s probably a glitch in the matrix—please don’t make eye contact.

I'm an introvert powered by silence, snacks, and a strong Wi-Fi connection. I enjoy peaceful activities like crafting, painting, and contemplating life while photographing birds that are completely unaware of how majestic they look. My idea of adventure is moving from one cozy chair to another. Walking? That’s a hard pass—why explore on foot when you have binoculars and excellent sitting posture? Nature is my happy place—as long as it doesn’t involve too much physical exertion or unexpected social interaction. If you're planning a hiking trip, I’ll cheer you on... from a very comfortable, stationary distance.
