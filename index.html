    <section id="about">
      <p>I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the <a href="https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005fa3;">Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science</span></a>, 
        <a href="https://ok.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005fa3;">University of British Columbia ‚Äì Okanagan</span></a>, 
        supervised by <a href="https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/mkhasan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005fa3;">Mohammad Khalad Hasan</span></a>. 
        I began my graduate studies as an MSc student under <a href="https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/mkhasan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005fa3;">Dr. Hasan</span></a> and later transitioned into the PhD program. 
        Before that, I earned my B.Sc. in <a href="https://www.sust.edu/departments/cse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005fa3;">Computer Science and Engineering</span></a> from <a href="https://www.sust.edu/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005fa3;">Shahjalal University of Science & Technology</span></a> (SUST), Bangladesh, 
        where I also worked as an undergraduate teaching faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

      <p>My research sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and ubiquitous computing. 
        I focus on designing and evaluating interaction techniques for mobile, wearable, and AR/VR devices. 
        As an HCI researcher, I investigate user preferences and develop interaction methods that enhance how people engage with smart technologies ‚Äî ranging from smartphones and smartwatches to immersive headsets. 
        My current interests include ubiquitous interfaces, mobile and wearable UI design, and next-generation interaction techniques.
        My research interest also includes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). 
        My work has been published at premier venues such as CHI, ISMAR, TVCG. I‚Äôve also collaborated with researchers across domains on interdisciplinary projects involving technology, behavior, and accessibility.</p>
